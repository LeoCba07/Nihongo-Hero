## The Problem

Traditional Japanese study apps are boring. Flashcards work, but they don't make you *want* to come back.

## The Solution

Nihongo Hero transforms language study into an RPG. Battle enemies by answering vocabulary questions — correct answers deal damage, mistakes cost health. Learning through combat.

### Features

- **Turn-based combat** — answer Japanese questions to attack enemies
- **TTS pronunciation** — hear questions spoken via VoiceVox API
- **Dynamic animations** — sword strikes, screen shake, floating damage numbers
- **Story mode** — progress through themed levels with increasing difficulty
- **Mobile-first PWA** — installable app for learning on the go
- **Leaderboard** — compete with other learners
